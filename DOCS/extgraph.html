<a name="preface" class="startofblock">Preface</a>
<p>
The ExtGraph Library is an add-on to the TIGCC Library (TIGCCLIB). It's a compile-time
library (used functions are fetched from the library during the linking stage) and it contains
various useful graphics related routines which are missing in the TIGCCLIB or modified routines
which are implemented with high speed in mind (without stupid excessive speed optimizations,
though, except for preshifted sprites which are a brute force approach).
For example, we unrolled tight loops in the tilemap engine, which costed around 12 bytes (&lt;
1/1000 of overall size for most programs using a tilemap engine), but increases speed by ~20%.<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> We do not / cannot guarantee that any compiler or cross-compiler for TI-68k
calculators other than TIGCC will support ExtGraph.<br><br>
<strong>The ExtGraph demos were tested on PedroM 0.81.</strong> All demos seem to work (although
PedroM 0.81 seems to suffer more from the keyboard rebounds than AMS, but I tested only on emulators)
and show that PedroM uses more efficient algorithms than AMS (in graphical functions - up to 0.80,
PedroM's vital memcpy and memset were very slow): ExtGraph outperforms PedroM on lines by &lt;~10%
and rectangles by &gt;~3x, while it usually outperforms AMS by &gt;~5x on lines and &gt;~7x on
rectangles.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The ExtGraph 2 series is supposed to be backwards compatible with the previous versions, except:
<ul>
<li>calculator model checking (now in a better way in TIGCC);</li>
<li>enum GrayColors (the values were changed in order to optimize a bit the fonctions that use
those values; anyway, the elements from the enum should be used instead of their values).</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>If you find something else that won't compile (especially the optimized pixel macros - bugs
were found and fixed many times), please report it to us !</strong>

<a name="improvement" class="startofblock">Improvements in ExtGraph 2.xx over 1.xx (incomplete list):</a>
<ul>
<li>Nearly all functions and even several macros were rewritten in pure assembly, resulting
in both size and speed improvements.</li>
<li>__attribute__((__regparm__)) routines (functions whose name ends with "_R") are now
available. They are faster and smaller than equivalent __attribute__((__stkparm__)) routines,
which were rewritten too, and are left for backwards compatibility. Few __stkparm__ routines
do not have a __regparm__ version, but many __regparm__ routines do not have a __stkparm__
versions. As a consequence, TIGCC 0.93 is not supported any more, but this version is no
longer the official release and is really outdated now. __stkparm__ routines should not be
used for new designs if they have __regparm__ equivalents.</li>
<li>clipped sprite routines, which can be used just like the normal (non-clipped) sprite
routines. The prototypes of the equivalent non-clipped and clipped routines are identical.
The clipped routines assume the planes they are given are 240x128 pixels, but you can easily
modify them to make them fit your needs (see the readme). Note that GrayClip(I)Sprite32
routines can be slow when clipping at the left or right sides, due to a high shift count
(the smaller the part onscreen is, the slower the clipping is).</li>
<li>a complete tilemap engine was added.</li>
<li>grayscale transparency routines (TRANB_R / TRANW_R - there are two samples of TRAND and
TRANL, GrayClipISprite16_TRAND/TRANL_R) are now available.</li>
<li>tile (aligned sprite) functions were added.</li>
<li>rectangle-drawing routines are now available.</li>
<li>other utility functions for X8(X8) sprites were added, the B/W SpriteX8 routines were
rewritten</li>
<li>support for preshifted sprites (brute-force-which-takes-up-a-high-amount-of-RAM)
is now available.</li>
<li>interlaced sprite functions were added.</li>
<li>special fast background save&amp;restore functions are now available.</li>
<li>transition effects were added.</li>
<li>triangle filling and circle drawing functions are now available.</li>
<li>documentation is clearer (although much bigger) and more usable by newbies than it used
to be (tips, comparisons between different approaches: see the <a href="S1P9/tutorial.html">TICT
tutorial S1P9</a> about optimization).
From Beta 5 on, the documentation was split into separate files for better readability.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<em>This is a beta, this means it may contain bugs we might not have seen despite our tests
(Beta 4 needed the entire library to be more or less retested, see the changelog). We
already saw a number of more or less severe bugs in all betas.</em>

<hr>
<a name="monster" class="startofblock">The grayscale monster functions</a>
<p>
The GraySprite routines are real "monsters" due to their number of parameters.
Thomas had never planned to implement them this way, but there were too many requests, that's
why he decided to implement these "monsters".<br>
We will not combine the consecutive planes into one double-sized plane for any <em>sprite</em>
routines. Indeed, this approach doesn't have any significant advantage speed-wise or
size-wise compared to the normal method, and if the official TIGCCLIB grayscale support
is used, it forbids both direct writes to the screen and doublebuffering, because the buffers
used by the official TIGCCLIB grayscale routine are not combined this way on HW1.<br>Other
routines, currently the tilemap engine and filled triangle and circle drawing functions,
use many registers in a permanent way, and their code is better if using combined planes.
I objected doing it for a very long time, but I finally made a fork of the TIGCCLIB routine,
which available starting from 2.00 Beta 5 in src/gray.s, see several paragraphs below for the
technical reasons behind that choice. This was downright trivial.<br>
GrayClipISprite8/16_... are speed-optimized by using interlaced sprites and two different
loops to optimize shiftings.<br>
A number of programs (vertical scroller Venus is one of them) contain routines whose prototype is
similar to that of GrayClipISprite routines (single pointer to a sprite), but the sprite format
is different: it contains the entire data for one plane, the entire data for the other plane,
the entire mask data if any (or any permutation of these three blocks). Using this format is
nearly as efficient speed-wise and speed-wise as using interlaced sprites. Starting from Beta
4, you can find information in the readme, so that all users (even those who don't know ASM,
what a shame) can modify them to use this format more easily.

<a name="grayscaletilemap" class="startofblock">About grayscale routines and the tilemap engine</a>
<p>
The tilemap engine is incompatible with the <em>official</em> TIGCCLIB grayscale doublebuffering
support, and this is unlikely to change for some time, see below why.<br>
<strong>If you want to use the tilemap engine or several infrequently-used ExtGraph functions (the
DrawSpans and the routines needing them) with the TIGCCLIB support API, please use
the forked support in /lib/gray.o (just add the file to the TIGCC project, or link with it, like
some demos now do)</strong>. Kevin's tilemap engine patch is rejected because it breaks the entire
tilemap engine API, and it changed the calling convention in a bad way. Using a4, also done in a
number of rarely-used TIGCCLIB functions, is bad because it prevents using -freg-relative-a4 or
global register variables in a4, which are the most efficient (size-wise and speed-wise) ways to
access global variables (-Wa,-l -mpcrel do not cover writes and are usually not usable for
programs larger than 32 KB).
<strong>The two types of routines mentioned above are the only valid reasons to use the forked
support. Other routines work obviously fine with the official support, and should therefore be
used with them.</strong><br>
I know I had written I objected to forking the TIGCCLIB grayscale support, but I decided to bite
the bullet as we had no other good solution, as written above. Forking was actually downright
trivial, I knew it from the beginning. Adding the other routine in TIGCCLIB was by far the
quickest and simplest solution, and it would have benefited to everyone (<em>most grayscale
routines behave the way the forked TIGCCLIB routine does</em>), and we would not have wasted
hours of our free time fighting... But we faced Kevin's stubbornness and intolerance. A summary
of his position, based on real posts and mails, is ~"this crap will never be in TIGCCLIB for
there is no valid reason, it just wastes memory. And don't insist, this makes me even less
willing to do so.", already shown in the first private mail I sent him about what I thought to
be a trivial issue.<br>
The forked support always allocates planes consecutively, even on HW1, which consumes 3840 more
bytes of memory on HW1 only (actually a couple dozen of bytes less because the routine is
simpler, that's neglectable). However, saying that this is an awful pessimization for no purpose
looks a gross oversimplification, if not a lie. In short, that memory couldn't be used anyway !
Indeed:</p>
<ul>
<li>HW2/3 usually run AMS 2.xx/3.xx (well, there is AMS 1.05, but that combination is extremely
infrequent), whose maximum amount of available memory is lesser or equal than that of AMS
1.xx/2.xx used on HW1. Programs have to be designed for the most limiting models - and the most
limiting ones are also by far the most common models nowadays, since no HW1s have been
manufactured since ~1999-2000 !<br>New users who have just bought a V200 (HW2+) or a 89T (HW3),
in 2004-2005, couldn't care less if the programs they use are taking up more or less memory on
some increasingly-infrequent model (HW1) they're not too likely to ever encounter...</li>
<li>There are more TSRs on AMS 2.xx/3.xx, for example Kevin's AutoAlphaLock Off and ExtendeD's
Integrated Desktop.<br>Programs shouldn't assume that they are the only programs using the memory
at a time, but in practice, they do. Most ASM programs use the AMS cooperative multitasking in a
non-cooperative way, and many TSRs are event hooks !</li>
<li>The default TIGCC options are nearly backwards compatible and have as little side effects
on the code as possible. But as a consequence, they do not yield optimal code, although the great
optimizing linker, enabled by default, saves kilobytes on large programs.<br>
Switching to optimized compilation options saves hundreds of bytes to kilobytes on nearly all
programs I tried them on. Optimizing the code by hand can save even more. I'm not even talking
about on-calc incompatibility. For more information on both, see S1P9, which is now inclued in
ExtGraph.</li>
<li>Greg Dietsche's HSR, which is &lt; 130 bytes (counting the cost of the call to subroutine
and return to parent, the standalone tool being 117 bytes), enables TI-Chess and suprisingly few
other programs to save 3840 bytes of heap memory - on all models - by redrawing the home screen
instead of saving/restoring it (which costs several dozens of bytes, whatever the way it is
done, SAVE_SCREEN on the stack or LCD_save/restore on the stack or heap).</li>
</ul>
<p>
Julien Richard-Foy is making a new grayscale library called Grib. It is significantly smaller
than the TIGCCLIB one, its API looks more like that of Genlib in some aspects (framerate
synchronization functions). It can use user-allocated planes, which also enables using the
ExtGraph tilemap engine (his work, like many things in ExtGraph !) with doublebuffering, provided
the planes are allocated consecutively.<br>

<a name="reportingbugsnote" class="startofblock">A note on reporting bugs...</a>
<hr>
<p>
We tried to do our best to provide something bug-free, but have probably failed (many bugs
were found in the previous ExtGraph 2.00 betas).<br>
If you believe a sprite function is buggy, could you please test it with the project
sprtst.tpr in /src/lib ? If the function is buggy, the program could show its flaws
(several flaws could be missed by the program though) and make your report more valueable.
Note that I have a large test suite for sprite functions.<br>
If a correct test doesn't show the function is buggy, well, then it's not unlikely that
there's a problem in your code ;-)<br>
One of the most frequent causes of random bugs is writes past the bounds of data section
arrays (segfaults on other architectures), of stack arrays (often triggers Illegal Instruction
or Address Error) or in the heap (often an infinite loop in AMS at the next allocation or after
the program returns). Be sure to check the result of dynamic memory allocations, too.<br>
Be sure to use the TIGCC 0.96 release, or newer.<br>
Thanks in advance.

<a name="extgraphindistros" class="startofblock">Including ExtGraph in your projects' distributions...</a>
<hr>
<p>
If you distribute ExtGraph within your projects' distributions, please include both extgraph.a and
extgraph.h (and tilemap.a / tilemap.h if you use the tilemap engine, preshift.h if you use preshifted
sprites). Don't get fooled by the huge size of those files: they are very redundant data, high
compression ratios can therefore be achieved on them. The biggest file, extgraph.a, is more than six
times smaller after compression with old ZIP format.<br>
If you modify ExtGraph functions, please mark your versions as modified in a clear way: this lowers
risks of spreading modified versions which don't behave like the original ones.<br>
</p>

<a name="specialthanks" class="startofblock">Special thanks to...</a>
<hr>
<p>
I'd like to thank the contributors, especially Julien Richard-Foy (jackiechan / Sasume -
author of the tilemap engine and various programs) and Geoffrey Anneheim (geogeo - author of
PolySnd, Arkanoid Revenge of Doh, Nebulus, GFA Basic, TI-Gen) once more for their work.
ExtGraph would never have been what it is if they had not helped me. My policy is of course
to let the contributors work on other projects if they want to, which they do for sure.
For example, Julien is now working on kernel-based dynamic graphical library GenLib, in
which he took ideas for the tilemap engine and optimizations on TRANB/W routines (also seen
in Phoenix Platinum).
