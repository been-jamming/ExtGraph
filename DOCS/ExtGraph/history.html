<tr><td><strong>Version</strong></td><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>Changes</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>2.00 Beta 5</td><td>xx/08/2005</td><td>Fixed silly bugs on pixel macros (yes, once more !).
                                        Credits go to Sebastian and Kevin for the fixes (escape one of
                                        the question marks that form trigraph ??!, etc.).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Restructured the entire documentation, so that it
                                        can be maintained and most of all read more easily. I
                                        myself didn't even feel like browsing that 180K block
                                        anymore, I guess ExtGraph users don't either. The main
                                        documentation is following the way started by the tilemap
                                        engine documentation - which is much smaller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>updated the documentation, made the HTML code cleaner
                                        using Firefox plugin HTML Validator. My schoolmate Yoann made
                                        me aware a while ago that the HTML code I used and made was
                                        poor (but at least, it uses CSS !).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed side clipping of GrayClipISprite8_MASK_R,
                                        thanks to Jean-François Geyelin for the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added new TestCollide routines (request from TIGCC/TICT
                                        board user "lachprog"), optimized existing ones.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added plane scaling routines. As all such routines,
                                        they eat up a lot of CPU time, they are rather large due to
                                        unrolled loops and/or lookup tables, they require doubling
                                        the space allocated to planes, their effect is more or less
                                        ugly (especially when there's text). Some games are more
                                        playable on 89 using that technique, but others should be
                                        adapted to the other screen size in order not to rely on
                                        those rather slow routines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Optimized and added single sprite -> 2 plane routines.
                                        Thanks to David Randall (Ranman) for the contribution and part
                                        of the coding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Optimized the source files for size: removed many useless
                                        "extern" and "register" keywords, saving ~12 KB in extgraph.h.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Switched to TIGCC 0.96 and its GCC 4.x, which required
                                        small changes in the build batchfile (which you should hardly
                                        ever use anyway).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Switched to a more general and powerful cleanup script
                                        which uses GNU tools under an Unix shell. Requires Cygwin
                                        or MSYS (untested) on Win32. Next step: port all batches to
                                        an Unix shell, so that building ExtGraph is trivial on *nix.
                                        I will have to do the same thing in most other TICT programs.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added a fork of the TIGCCLIB grayscale routine, which
                                        can run the tilemap engine, and a mention of Grib. See
                                        <a href="../extgraph.html">the root of this documentation</a>
                                        for more information.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added GrayClipISpriteX16_MASK_R, based on Genlib's
                                        put_masked_big_sprite, made by Julien RF; made several other
                                        X16 routines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added three ClipSpriteX8 routines, based on code by
                                        Geoffrey Anneheim (geogeo), which I significantly optimized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Created GrayClipISprite16_TRAND/L_R as an example of
                                        TRAND/L routines. The readme used to be wrong about making
                                        TRAND/L from TRANB/W, and making TRAND/L was not so easy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>On 12/08/2005, created a SVN repository for ExtGraph at
                                        <a href="http://opensvn.csie.org/ExtGraph">http://opensvn.csie.org/ExtGraph</a>.
                                        Anonymous checkout allowed, but recommended only to check if
                                        particular bugs were fixed since the latest beta/release.
                                        Indeed, the trunk may contain broken things or break the API
                                        without notice - and it did multiple times in the few weeks
                                        before this beta, especially when I was adding triangle/circle
                                        functions and their DrawSpan subroutines !</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed GrayClip(I)Sprite32_MASK_R. Thanks to Olivier
                                        Givaudan for the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed *SpriteX8Get(_R), they used to crash the
                                        calculator when bytewidth was &lt; 2. Thanks to Geoffrey
                                        Anneheim (geogeo) for the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed a long-hidden bug on FastFillRect(_R) in A_REVERSE
                                        mode. Thanks to Olivier Givaudan for the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Tested in unusual conditions (low bytewidths,
                                        both dimensions odd) and eventually fixed
                                        (Clip)SpriteX8(_R) routines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Changed several function names, only rarely-used ones, to
                                        make them more consistent with other names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed a number of simple rectangle functions.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added FastTestLine_*_R.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Optimized FastLine_*_R for both size and speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed FastDrawLine(_R) in A_XOR mode and FastLine_Invert_R:
                                        there was often a problem at the middle of the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added PixCollide*_R routines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added (Gray)(Clip)FillTriangle_R and callbacks for them.
                                        The architecture (routine + callback) is close to that of
                                        Genlib, with good reason. The grayscale versions require
                                        modified grayscale routines (see an item above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added GrayFastDrawLine_R.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added ClipLine_R and (Gray)ClipDrawLine_R.
                                        The architecture (routine + callback) is close to that of
                                        Genlib, with good reason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Made the prototypes of most X8 functions more explicit,
                                        using "bytewidth" instead of "w". Thanks to MathStuf for the
                                        report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added m68k-coff-ar for PC/Win32 and PC/Linux in /bin. If
                                        someone provides me binaries for other architectures, I can add them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added more B/W and grayscale outlined and filled
                                        circle drawing routines. The grayscale versions require
                                        modified grayscale routines (see an item above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Checked and fixed several types in the prototypes,
                                        after MathStuf reported a crash which turned out to be due
                                        to a char array being at an odd address, where an even
                                        address was assumed by DoubleSpriteDimensionsX8_R. As far as
                                        I could see, it was the only true such problem in the
                                        prototypes... While I was at it, I switched to explicit
                                        registers in ScrollX_R routines, checking that I didn't
                                        break the ABI.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.00 Beta 4</td><td>25/12/2004</td><td>removed (I)SHADOW(2) routines: they are nearly
                                        useless thanks to Create(I)Sprite(I)Shadow and OR routines
                                        (which require a small additional amount of space) and
                                        they increase maintenance (more than one quarter of all
                                        drawing modes).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>added Gray(Clip)S[ame]MASK routines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>added a number of hints in the readme, to help
                                        users customizing routines by themselves.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>added fast background save&amp;restore routines,
                                        with the corresponding demo (demo22): faster replacement
                                        for Get + RPLC, i.e. another way to do without redrawing
                                        everything all the time. This one can outperform all other
                                        approaches under some conditions.<br>
                                        Thanks to the input of Julien, they are better.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>fixed once more pixel macros, thanks to Kevin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>added missing "const" keyword to most prototypes:
                                        at last, no more warnings about discarded qualifiers.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>nearly all occurences of ".data" were replaced by
                                        ".text". This suits better to the latest TIGCC Betas
                                        (better code with -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections
                                        --reorder-sections). No impact on compression ratio.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Reduced length of all label names in most ASM
                                        routines (unless this made the routines both unreadable
                                        and impossible to maintain). This saved dozens of
                                        kilobytes on extgraph.a (up to 500 bytes per function !)
                                        and .s sources, and improved compression ratio !</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>ExtGraph doesn't force global imports (from the
                                        external files added with GNU ar) anymore. This saves
                                        ~6 KB on the size of extgraph.a and won't interfere
                                        with clients anymore. Thanks to Sebastian for the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Julien told me about speed optimizations on TRANW
                                        and TRANB sprite routines (found in programs by pad and
                                        PpHd): +15% for TRANW, +&gt;30 % for TRANB.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>small optimization (2 bytes, 4 clocks) on a number
                                        of sprite routines. [A and B] is equivalent to [B and A]...</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>small optimization on several routines: d3 or d4
                                        can be saved to a1 instead of the stack.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>fixed long-hidden bugs. Most B/W Sprite32 routines
                                        were buggy, thanks to Jesse Frey for the report. I found
                                        other long-hidden bugs retesting the entire library.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>updated the tilemap engine. The API was reduced
                                        somewhat: Julien took out with the most useless modes
                                        to reduce maintenance. Two demos were added. However,
                                        the tilemap engine is still incompatible with the
                                        TIGCCLIB grayscale doublebuffering.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>brand-new pure ASM ttunpack routines by Samuel
                                        Stearley. The fast version gives a huge speed increase
                                        (now over 80 KB/sec !), interesting size decrease (while
                                        the routine is definitely optimized for speed, with
                                        code inlining, and we did not trade safety for speed
                                        and size !) compared to the C routine Greg, him and
                                        later I had optimized. The small version is 240 bytes
                                        (more than 300 bytes smaller than the other version),
                                        but it is slow (~&lt;20 KB/sec).</td></tr>
