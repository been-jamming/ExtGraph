<tr><td><strong>Version</strong></td><td><strong>Date</strong></td><td><strong>Changes</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>2.00 Beta 5</td><td>xx/xx/2008</td><td>Fixed silly bugs on <strong>pixel macros</strong> (yes, once more !).
                                        Credits go to Sebastian and Kevin for the fixes (escape one of
                                        the question marks that form trigraph ??!, etc.).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Restructured the entire documentation, so that it
                                        can be maintained and most of all read more easily. I
                                        myself didn't even feel like browsing that 180K block
                                        anymore, I guess ExtGraph users don't either. The main
                                        documentation is following the way started by the tilemap
                                        engine documentation - which is much smaller.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td><strong>updated the documentation</strong>, made the HTML code cleaner
                                        using Firefox plugin HTML Validator. My schoolmate Yoann made
                                        me aware a while ago that the HTML code I used and made was
                                        poor (but at least, it used CSS !).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed side clipping of <strong>GrayClipISprite8_MASK_R</strong>,
                                        thanks to Jean-François Geyelin for the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added new <strong>TestCollide</strong> routines (request from TIGCC/TICT
                                        board user "lachprog"), optimized existing ones. Some contributed by
                                        Joey Adams.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added <strong>plane scaling routines</strong>. As all such routines,
                                        they eat up a lot of CPU time, they are rather large due to
                                        unrolled loops and/or lookup tables, they require increasing
                                        the space allocated to planes, their effect is more or less
                                        ugly (especially when there's text). Some games are more
                                        playable on 89 using that technique, but others should be
                                        adapted to the other screen size in order not to rely on
                                        those rather slow routines.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Optimized and added <strong>single sprite -> 2 plane routines</strong>.
                                        Thanks to David Randall (Ranman) for the contribution and part
                                        of the coding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Optimized the source files for size: removed many useless
                                        "extern" and "register" keywords, saving ~12 KB in extgraph.h.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Switched to TIGCC 0.96 and its GCC 4.x, which required
                                        small changes in the build batchfile (which you should hardly
                                        ever use anyway).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Like in several other TICT programs, switched to sh
                                        scripts, added a make distribution script and a more general
                                        and powerful cleanup script. They require a compatible shell
                                        and tools, that is Cygwin or MSYS (untested) on Win32 (builtin
                                        on Linux, MacOS X, BSD). The Win32 batchfiles, when
                                        they exist, have been left. Changed path references to use
                                        forward slashes.<br>Note that the switch creates problems with
                                        the IDE, which handles files in different folders in a
                                        sloppy way. Now I understand why Godzil, PpHd ("Moi maudire
                                        l'IDE jusqu'à son arrière-petit-fils" ;-) ), etc. don't like
                                        the IDE. I didn't see what the problem is, because I had never
                                        stumbled across it, but now I know it sucks. Of course, there's
                                        tprbuilder, but going from the IDE to the shell to launch it
                                        and vice-versa is an annoyance.<br></td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added a <strong>fork of the TIGCCLIB grayscale routine</strong>, which
                                        can run the tilemap engine, and a mention of Grib. See
                                        <a href="../extgraph.html">the root of this documentation</a>
                                        for more information. I integrated the fix for the double
                                        GrayOn(); crash. Kevin said at least three times on the TIGCC/TICT
                                        board that it is unsupported software that WILL be
                                        sabotaged. If he does, well, <em>(the official)</em> TIGCC
                                        will become something that one can freely distribute and
                                        modify - but not use, won't it ?</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added <strong>GrayClipISpriteX16_MASK_R</strong>, based on Genlib's
                                        put_masked_big_sprite, made by Julien RF. Made OR and RPLC.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added three <strong>ClipSpriteX8</strong> routines, based on code by
                                        Geoffrey Anneheim (geogeo), which I significantly optimized.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Created <strong>GrayClipISprite16_TRAND/L_R</strong> as an example of
                                        TRAND/L routines. The readme used to be wrong about making
                                        TRAND/L from TRANB/W, and making TRAND/L was not so easy after
                                        all.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>On 2005/08/12, created a <strong>SVN repository</strong> for ExtGraph at
                                        <a href="http://opensvn.csie.org/ExtGraph">http://opensvn.csie.org/ExtGraph</a>.
                                        Anonymous checkout allowed, obviously, especially since the trunk was, for
                                        nearly three years, the only way to have the numerous bugfixes of this release.
                                        As every SVN trunk, the trunk may sometimes contain broken or short-lived new
                                        functions. It did several times in the long time before this beta, especially
                                        when I was adding triangle/circle functions and their DrawSpan subroutines !</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed <strong>GrayClip(I)Sprite32_MASK_R</strong>. Thanks to Olivier
                                        Givaudan for the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed <strong>*SpriteX8Get(_R)</strong>, they used to crash the
                                        calculator when bytewidth was &lt; 2. Thanks to Geoffrey
                                        Anneheim (geogeo) for the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed a long-hidden bug on <strong>FastFillRect(_R)</strong> in A_REVERSE
                                        mode. Thanks to Olivier Givaudan for the report.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Tested in unusual conditions (low bytewidths,
                                        both dimensions odd) and fixed
                                        <strong>(Clip)SpriteX8(_R)</strong> routines if necessary.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Changed several function names, only rarely-used ones, to
                                        make them more consistent with other names.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed a number of simple <strong>rectangle functions</strong>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added <strong>FastTestLine_*_R</strong>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Optimized <strong>FastLine_*_R</strong> for both size and speed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Fixed <strong>FastDrawLine(_R)</strong> in A_XOR mode and
                                        <strong>FastLine_Invert_R</strong>: there was often a glitch
                                        at the middle of the line.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added <strong>PixCollide*_R</strong> routines, courtesy
                                        of several TIGCC/TICT board users, especially Jesse Frey.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added <strong>(Gray)(Clip)FillTriangle_R</strong> and callbacks for them.
                                        The architecture (routine + callback) is close to that of
                                        Genlib, with good reason. The grayscale versions require
                                        modified grayscale routines (see an item above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added <strong>GrayFastDrawLine_R</strong>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added <strong>ClipLine_R</strong> and
                                        <strong>(Gray)ClipDrawLine_R</strong>. They use the
                                        Cohen-Sutherland line clipping algorithm. I know of another
                                        algorithm, which is said to be faster, and I have a 68000
                                        assembly implementation of it, but the code is so much larger
                                        than it would have to be optimized for size...
                                        The architecture (routine + callback) is close to that of
                                        Genlib, with good reason.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Made the prototypes of most X8 functions more explicit,
                                        using "bytewidth" instead of "w". Thanks to MathStuf for the
                                        report. Likewise, X16 functions use "wordwidth".</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added m68k-coff-ar for PC/Win32 and PC/Linux in /bin. If
                                        someone provides me binaries for other architectures,
                                        I can add them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added more <strong>B/W and grayscale outlined and filled
                                        circle drawing routines</strong>. The grayscale versions require
                                        modified grayscale routines (see an item above).</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Checked and fixed several types in the prototypes,
                                        after MathStuf reported a crash which turned out to be due
                                        to a char array being at an odd address, where an even
                                        address was assumed by DoubleSpriteDimensionsX8_R for the
                                        destination. As far as I could see, it was the only true such
                                        problem in the prototypes... While I was at it, I switched to
                                        explicit registers in ScrollX_R routines, checking that I didn't
                                        break the ABI. Kevin suggests using <code>__attribute__((__aligned__(2)))</code>,
                                        but I don't know if I'll add that, because it bloats the header
                                        only to fix very infrequent problems.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added <strong>generic sprite rotation routines (8, 16, 32, X8)</strong>,
                                        courtesy of Joey Adams. Added a demo.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Optimized the transition effects and sprite routines
                                        for size: stupid dbf+rts combination. Kevin reported
                                        another rare pessimization, but I cannot find it looking at
                                        all non-clipped (Gray)Sprite* routines, and I know I fixed
                                        routines with such a pessimization a while ago. Fixed a severe
                                        bug that would occur only with unusual parameters in a number
                                        of transition effects, optimized their source to use local
                                        labels: extgraph.a is more than 3 KB smaller now.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Revamped the <strong>ScaleSprite</strong> routines with faster,
                                        smaller and "legally"-unencumbered code from Julien RF. My bad for not
                                        adding those routines for so long, that was pretty easy after all.
                                        Added X8 version.</td></tr>
<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>Added <strong>GrayClipSprite16_SMASKBLIT_R</strong> and
                                        <strong>UpsideDownGrayClipSprite16_MASK_R</strong>, both made for

<tr><td>           </td><td>          </td><td>In December 2007, switched to a DSCM (Git) for managing the commits.
                                        Kevin still says that first-generation centralized CVS works well...
                                        Yeah, sure, it doesn't even work reliably when there's only one committer (non-atomic
                                        commit, the kind of shortcomings that should be enough for any rational human being to
                                        dismiss CVS outright...), I've experienced it myself.<br>
                                        What's more, CVS is slow, it doesn't have native support for mirroring, its tagging and
                                        branching are inefficient, and it doesn't know how to stack multiple commits locally
                                        (and rewrite them if necessary, before committing them to the central repository).<br>
