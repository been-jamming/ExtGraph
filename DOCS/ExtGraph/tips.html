<ul>
<li>In a program, using B/W AND grayscale or non-clipped AND clipped versions of the same
routine is usually pointless, size-wise and speed-wise. Instead, calling twice the B/W
function is smaller, while usually only slightly slower; clipped sprite functions can be
considered as fast as non-clipped functions for the sprites that do not need to be clipped
(have a look at the code). Of course, testing whether you have to call a clipped sprite
function or not wastes even more time, since the clipped function performs the necessary
tests itself.</li>
<li>Always optimize your code, think about better algorithms, etc. I'll give those examples:
<ul>
<li>Jim Babcock (JimRandomH) once suggested a rather wierd but efficient algorithm to check
whether a sprite is on the visible part of the screen or not, replying to Malcolm Smith
(TRgenius) asking for a better method. Transcript of the relevant part of the
<a href="http://pub26.ezboard.com/ftichessteamhqfrm5.showMessage?topicID=2401.topic">thread</a>:<br>
<code><strong>Q:</strong> What is the most efficient way to handle a large number of sprites in a
2D game, as in not having to check if all of them are within the 'active' window each frame ?
Most Duke I levels have around 275 active sprites, but one level has *614*. I considered sorting
them by X or Y coordinate, but that would still result in a lot of extra sprites being scanned
that wouldn't be onscreen.<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Divide the entire playing field into roughly screen-sized segments, each of
which is the base of a linked list, and hash the sprites into that space. Then when drawing,
there will be at most four segments visible on screen, so iterate through the four corresponding
lists doing a more precise bounds check. This algorithm is optimal (O(N) to the number of
sprites on the screen), but hard to implement.</code></li>
<li>Geoffrey Anneheim (geogeo) was experiencing a too low speed when they were the maximum
number of items onscreen in Arkanoid (~8 FPS). Precomputing the sprite shadows takes a bit
more memory (there's still plenty of free memory though), but enables using OR routines
instead of SHADOW routines, saving thousands of clocks each frame !</li>
</ul>
<li>Redrawing everything every frame (an implementation choice where preshifted sprites
can be used) is hardly ever necessary and often detrimental to speed. Patrick Davidson
uses XOR and TRANW/MASK drawing modes in his games, nobody can say he's a bad programmer.
The framerate of Travis Fischer's Sumo wrestling game skyrocketed (way above 20 FPS) when
he switched to smarter methods (SpriteX8_Get_R - which is far from optimized for
speed !)... This is also why I wrote fast background save&amp;restore functions.</li>
<li>The screen of our TI-68k calculators is not designed for fast action. Framerates above
20 FPS are not relevant. This leaves CPU time for more effects, better AI, better GFX
(doublebuffering, see S1P6 tutorial by TICT, Ice Hockey 68k, etc.). Using brute-force
to get higher framerates than what's enough takes more memory, which may be <em>in fine</em>
detrimental to the game itself (less features due to lack of memory...). We're pretty happy
with the ~15 FPS in Duke68k, a bit more in Ice Hockey 68k, aren't we ?</li>
</ul>
<br>
Three general optimization tips (which you can find with many others in the upcoming TICT
tutorial S1P9) are:
<ul>
<li>loop optimization: use auxiliary pointers or postincremented/predecremented mode.</li>
<li>if/else if or switch optimization: try to make the items as symmetric as possible.</li></ul>
Two of those three optimizations (second one is N/A) were performed in the latest version
(2.10) of star (Starfield Effect by TICT), the latest version of TI-Miner, etc.
