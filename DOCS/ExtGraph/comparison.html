Phoenix (&amp; Phoenix Platinum), Krypton, Venus; simple strategy games (although sprite functions are often much
better since they are much more flexible)</td>

<h2>Comment:</h2>
<h3>As you can see above, normal sprite functions are enough most of the time. ExtGraph
provides many alternatives: tilemap engine, tile functions, brute-force (preshifted
sprite macros)... If there are sprites moving on a background which is not refreshed too often,
think of fast background save&amp;restore functions (see demo22).</h3>
