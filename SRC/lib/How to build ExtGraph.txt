Building extgraph.a is neither necessary nor recommended, since ExtGraph comes already built as a static library.

Instructions: Either
* Execute buildcompletelib.bat under Dos/Windows or buildcompletelib under a *nix shell.
or
* Compile ExtGraph.tpr in the IDE or with tprbuilder.
* Execute buildlib.bat or buildlib (TIGCC 0.95 and GNU tool ar (m68k-coff) needed).
