* Rewrite these routines in optimized assembly (both __regparm__ and __stkparm__). They're 
currently faster than the previous versions, since the SpriteX8 are significantly faster than 
the previous versions (see the speedup on demo6), but calling a SpriteX8 twice is slower than a 
full-blown GraySpriteX8.
* Keep the "slower" versions nevertheless (smaller).
