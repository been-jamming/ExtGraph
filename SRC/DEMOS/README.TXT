This directory contains the following demos programs:
-----------------------------------------------------

demo1  - test program for plane scrolling functions
demo2  - test program for fast line drawing function
demo3  - test program for fast sprite drawing functions
demo4  - test program for sprite get functions
demo5  - test program for scale sprite functions
demo6  - test program for SpriteX8 functions: oversized sprites + several effects such as
         mirror and simple (90°) rotate
demo7  - test program for grayscale support functions
demo8  - test program for FloodFill function
demo9  - test program for SpriteX8 mirror functions
demo10 - test program for FastCopyScreen function
demo11 - test program for TestCollide8/TestCollide16
demo12 - test program for clipped sprite functions
demo13 - test program for high level tilemap engine functions: two overlapping maps
         (tilemap engine demo 1)
demo14 - test program for low level tilemap engine functions: animated tiles, obsolete
         (tilemap engine demo 2)
demo15 - test program for high level tilemap engine functions: animated tiles, better
         than demo14 (tilemap engine demo 3)
demo16 - test program for low level tilemap engine functions (shift tables), amazing
         (tilemap engine demo 4)
demo17 - tilemap-engine-based version of demo12 using high level functions (twice
         faster) + plane SHADOW
demo18 - test program for transition effects (far from complete)
demo19 - test program for various graphical functions: rectangle drawing (complete),
         circle drawing/filling, clipped triangle filling.
demo20 - test program for tile (aligned sprites) functions
demo21 - test program for preshifted sprites functions and macros
demo22 - test program for non-clipped fast save/restore functions (uses tilemap
         engine as well)
demo23 - test program for clipped fast save/restore functions: highly simplified kind
         of Phoenix Platinum / Krypton / Venus / etc. Not coded yet.
demo24 - test program for high level tilemap engine functions: MASK mode, three
         overlapping planes, one transparent (3 colors) and two full (4 colors)
         (tilemap engine demo 5)
demo25 - test program for low level tilemap engine functions: tile functions
         (tilemap engine demo 6)
demo26 - kernel-based (!! AFAIK the only kernel-based program from TICT ;-) !!) bench
         program old graphlib vs. ExtGraph. Everything was made so that Genlib can
         easily be added
demo27 - test program for sprite arbitrary angle rotation functions
